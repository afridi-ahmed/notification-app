### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/afridi-ahmed/notification-app my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev:ios
# Or
npm run dev:android
```

This will open the app in the iOS simulator or Android emulator.
